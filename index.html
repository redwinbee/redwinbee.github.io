            <h2>Hello</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently an undergraduate student at Queens College, CUNY pursuing a Computer Science, B.S degree
                with a personal preference on compilers, interpreters, and regular expressions. I am currently working
                on
                <a href="https://github.com/redwinbee/stix">stix</a> which is the bytecode implementation (clox) from
                the
                <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a>
                book. The goal of this project is to learn about the techniques used in implementing compiled programs
                that run on top of a VM such as bytecode representation, static analysis, and garbage collection.<br /><br />

                As you can tell from this website, I am most definitely not a web designer. Something about creating UI
                elements and crafting the perfect UX experience was something that never clicked with me&mdash;perhaps
                because many of the websites that I frequent run <em>incredibly</em> slow on my machine; despite running
                relatively new hardware. As such, you'll find that this website was created using plain HTML/CSS and
                should load very quickly on almost any machine.<br /><br />

                <em>Call it old school, but this is how I was taught to write websites.</em>
